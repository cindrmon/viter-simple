    h1 About This Template
    p This template is made using anything not vanilla in mind, in which everything is run through a compiler. Pug is basically python syntaxxed HTML, SASS and TS are a superset of CSS and JS, respectively, and everything would eventually be compiled down to HTML+CSS+JS using vite's very fast bundler. 
    p Another thing to take note is that this does not use any css framework (tailwind, vuetify, etc), becuase I just realised that almost all of them don't even have proper Vue 3 or Vite support at all (for the UI component libraries so far), and that Tailwind is just CSS but in the form of classes, and I could've just wrote plain CSS either way, so that's why I eventually got to this idea.
    p Feel free to edit some stuff around here.
