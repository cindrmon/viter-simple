# Base

> This README.md is referenced from (https://github.com/KittyGiraudel/sass-boilerplate/tree/master/stylesheets/base). You may also get scss examples here as well.

The `base/` folder holds what we might call the boilerplate code for the project. In there, you might find some typographic rules, and probably a stylesheet (that Iâ€™m used to calling `_base.scss`), defining some standard styles for commonly used HTML elements.

In the case for using vue3 + vite, it is entirely optional due to scoped sass/scss rules for each vue component. It is just added here just in case.
