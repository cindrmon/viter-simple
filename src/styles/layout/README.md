# Layout

> This README.md is referenced from (https://github.com/KittyGiraudel/sass-boilerplate/tree/master/stylesheets/layout). You may also get scss examples here as well.

The `layout/` folder contains everything that takes part in laying out the site or application. This folder could have stylesheets for the main parts of the site (header, footer, navigation, sidebarâ€¦), the grid system or even CSS styles for all the forms.

While in vue, you may opt not to use this as you can do scoped sass/scss in each vue component.
